Stuff need todo
[ ]	Encryption
[ ] Standardize format
	- packet version
	- secure mode? <- keep anonymize secure is hidden until the application tries to decrypt the random data
	- extension (png,zip,etc)
	- bit encoding
	- length
	- integrity check code (parity of data) 
	- Header check (yes continue to grab data, no exit saying not an incoded imaged)
[X]	Equalize randomness on the image to prevent one section marked with encryption
[ ] Give a image statistics to tell the capabilites of the image and how much data can fit in (check/stats)
[ ]	Fix up run
[ ]	Fix up debug and verbose stuff
	debug - output dump data
	verbose - tells what it is doing
[ ] Create standard libraries for each to maintain sanity
	- cli
	- gui
	- utility (pngeutil.h)
	- secure (openssl_api.h)
[ ] Write report
